> _"A well-timed snippet is worth ten thousand Stack Overflow searches."_

Welcome to **The Lalaalaaabrary** — a chaos-controlled vault of code spells, tech tricks, and command-line conjuring. Every snippet in this archive has been battle-tested, annotated, and lovingly stashed away for Future You to summon in a moment of need.

## 🪄 Tips for Usage
- Keep commits small, atomic, and titled with intent: `add: jq script to extract GTM ID`
- Use the Obsidian Git plugin to auto-sync on save or set a recurring commit
- Tag often. Even better? Create backlinks to related notes.
- Snippets that fail? KEEP THEM. Just annotate why.

## 🔐 Version Control
This vault is backed by Git and synced to GitHub. 
Use branches for experiments if needed, but main is your golden grimoire.

## 👻 Credit Where It's Due
This vault may contain fragments of borrowed spells (a.k.a. Stack Overflow answers). Always credit sources in notes.

Happy hacking, sorcerer. 🪄
